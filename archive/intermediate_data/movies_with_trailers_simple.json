Viewers who delight in the subversion of genre tropes and revel in the unconventional will find \"Poultrygeist\" to be a refreshing departure from mainstream fare. It thrives on its shock value and embraces its status as a cult classic in the making, destined to be celebrated by those who seek out the weirdest and wildest offerings in the indie film landscape."
