# Golden Dataset for Movie Profile Evaluation

## Overview

This directory contains curated edge case movies for evaluating and improving the movie profile generation prompt, specifically focusing on the `profile_text` field quality.

## Files

### `movies.json`
- 20 carefully selected edge case movies
- Categories: Classic Cinema, Contemporary International, Middle Eastern & Asian, Latin American, Experimental, Documentary-style Fiction
- Selection criteria: Films where generic descriptions fail to capture specific movements, cultural context, or technical innovations

### `generated_profiles_v1.0.json`
- Baseline profile_text outputs using current prompt (v1.0)
- Contains 5 movies: Citizen Kane, Tangerine, Close-Up, Bicycle Thieves, In the Mood for Love
- Extracted from `movie_profiles_merged.json`
- Generated: 2025-10-18

### `ground_truth.json`
- Expert-level reference profiles generated by LLM (GroundTruthGenerator)
- Used as benchmark for evaluating generated profiles
- Created using enhanced prompts with specific movement/historical/technical requirements

### `human_evaluations/batch_1_results.json`
- Human evaluation results for Tangerine and Close-Up
- Structured ratings across 5 categories (1-5 stars)
- Detailed annotations identifying failure modes

## Evaluation Criteria

Based on human feedback, profile_text is evaluated on:

1. **Cinema Movement Identification**: Specific movement names (not "indie film landscape")
2. **Socio-Cultural Context**: Historical era, political/social conditions, economic context
3. **Formal/Technical Analysis**: Cinematographer names, specific techniques
4. **Narrative Specifies**: Character names, plot elements, casting decisions
5. **Distinctiveness**: What makes this film unique, avoiding generic praise

## Known Failure Modes (v1.0)

From human evaluation:

- **Citizen Kane**: Generic "visually striking", missing Gregg Toland/deep focus, called "indie film landscape" instead of Classical Hollywood
- **Tangerine**: Generic "transgender actresses", vague "unique filming technique" (should specify iPhone 5), missing specific plot elements
- **Close-Up**: Missing Iranian New Wave, missing late 1980s Iran context, no technical analysis, missing casting innovation (real people playing themselves)
- **Bicycle Thieves**: Mentions neorealism but missing post-war Italy specifics
- **In the Mood for Love**: Missing Christopher Doyle cinematography, missing 1960s Hong Kong context, called "indie film landscape"

## Next Steps

1. Generate v1.1 profiles using enhanced prompt
2. Conduct human re-evaluation
3. Compare v1.0 vs v1.1 scores
4. Iterate until 4/5 average rating achieved
